Since there isn't a good way to collect data from SWGoH for mods I decided I'd make one. Using python3 and BeautifulSoup4 modscraper3.py will pull together an accounts mod data to import through json to Datatables, a jquery plug-in. Which will display it in a table with multi sort for columns and search options.

Now that the data acquisition is complete I need to finish a front end, or app, for account login and storing mod data so it doesn't need to be updated until requested. Probably storing the json in a table and using the same account name that's listed on swgoh, or requiring it, to pull into the scrape script.
